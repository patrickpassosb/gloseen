# Task: Create Architecture Diagram in README

## Objective
Create a professional README.md with a clear architecture diagram using Mermaid to document the Blindur project structure and data flow.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `README.md` is populated with project title and description.
- [ ] A Mermaid diagram is included that shows the interaction between ESP32-CAM, Flask Backend, Azure AI Services, and the Database.
- [ ] The diagram correctly represents the data flow (Capture -> Analysis -> Feedback).

## Impact
- **Documentation**: Easier for new contributors or reviewers (like ImagineCup judges) to understand the technical stack.
- **Clarity**: Visualizes the distributed nature of the project (Edge + Cloud).

## TO-DO
- [x] Draft the project description.
- [x] Design the Mermaid architecture diagram.
- [x] Update `README.md` with the content.

## Progress
- Analyzed `app.py` and `blindur.ino` to understand components.
- Designed a comprehensive Mermaid diagram showing Edge-Cloud interaction.
- Populated `README.md` with high-quality project documentation.
